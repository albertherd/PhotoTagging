TL;DR:
  1) Get a Microsoft Cognitive Services Account - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ai/ 
  
  2) Create a new Cognitive Services Resource and get the API key - https://portal.azure.com/#create/hub
  
  3) Download the application, navigate to PhotoAnalyser.cs. Change the subscriptionKey and uriBase to the ones you got previously. The keys in the solution are placeholder keys only.
  
  4) Get your photos tagged! - have your photo directory ready as this is asked for at runtime.
  
  5) Enjoy!
